    "We will now dig deeper into the idea of multiple dispatch by seeing how \"objects\" in Julia are defined, constructed, and related to one another. I put \"objects\" in quotation marks because they are not 100% like objects in the sense of Object Oriented Programming (and, sure, you can do OOP in Julia, although it will be quite awkward). Specifically, Julia objects do not have methods of their own; all methods, even constructors, are defined outside of the object definition block, and their scopes are not surrounded by a bigger scope delimited by the object(s) they work with. \n",

    "Before sinking our teeth into the content, I'll clear up some terms (some of which were briefly mentioned in Tutorial 1 but haven't been discussed in detail) and throw in a few tldr notes (as a sneak peek of how Julia is quite different from many popular languages):\n",

    "- There are **abstract types** and **concrete types**.\n",
    "- Types are related to each other by a graph where all non-leaf nodes are abstract types and all leafs are concrete types.\n",
    "- Concrete types cannot be supertypes of any other type. They are final. \n",
    "- Only abstract types are allowed to supertype other types. An abstract type can also can be (and in most cases) is a subtype of another abstract type.\n",
    "- Concrete types are further divided into primitive types and composite types.\n",

    "Wow, let's slow down and unpack each code block above. First, we define `DataScienceStudent` and `SoftwareStudent` as subtypes of `CS23` (because they both belong to the computer science department of a college). We also defined `FineArtStudent` as a subtype of `Art23`. Then we defined a function called `dorm_building` that does a pretty weird thing: assign a pair of roommates to a dorm building based on their majors. `dorm_building` now only has 1 method that accepts one student from the art department and another from the CS department, which puts all of them in Building B unless one of them studies fine art and the other data science (told you it was weird). Type abstraction allows defining only one method for that task: we do not have to write a dozen other methods to deal with every pair of majors chosen from the art and the CS departments.\n",

    "You might have noticed that because Julia does not allow structure inheritance, everytime we defined a subtype (namely `DataScienceStudent` and `SoftwareStudent`), we had to copy-paste the fields from this subtype to another.
