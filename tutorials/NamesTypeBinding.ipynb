    "This first tutorial walks you through the basics of variable names, types, and binding behaviors in Julia without bogging you down in the specifics and jargons of language design. Which is honestly quite a lot to learn already: Julia has a few idiosyncracies that are either unseen in or remixes from popular languages like Python, C++, Lisp, Matlab, and so on. "

    "Let's start with variable names. Actually, let's start with the 29 reserved keywords that must *not* be variable names, which are `baremodule`, `begin`, `break`, `catch`, `const`, `continue`, `do`, `else`, `elseif`, `end`, `export`, `false`, `finally`, `for`, `function`, `global`, `if`, `import`, `let`, `local`, `macro`, `module`, `quote`, `return`, `struct`, `true`, `try`, `using`, and `while`. Other than those, you can name your variables in whatever ways you want, as long as they\n",
    "\n",
    "- do not start with any digit or symbols other than letters (a-z or A-Z), underscore `_`, emojis, and a handful of other symbols whose Unicode points are greater than 00A0 (the best way to find out which ones exactly is, unfortunately, trial-and-error), and\n",
    "- continue with all such symbols as well as `!` and digits (0-9) (and a few others that are also unfortunately best found out by trial-and-error).\n",
    "\n",
    "To make things less confusing and more readable, the following conventions created by the Julia community should be adopted:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Names should all start with Roman letters.\n",
    "- Variable names should be in `snake_case` (although they are encouraged to be short and not having any underscore \"`_`\") and all lowercase.\n",
    "- Constant names should be capitalized and in `SNAKE_CASE`.\n",
    "- Structs, Types and Modules should begin with a capital letter and be in upper `CamelCase`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some Julia programmers use Greek letters and some uncommon symbols to name mathematical variables, which are apparently accepted by the Julia community. However, I find them a bit inconvenient: to type a symbol like Σ, you either need to have a keyboard mapping that supports it or type `\\Sigma`*-tab* in the Julia shell."

This behavior implies one thing that differentiates Julia from other statically typed languages: type declaration most likely does *not* introduce any performance gain, since the compiler has to infer the variable's type anyway regardless of the declared type. Take a look at the next block of code, which shows that there is almost no difference in execution time between dynamic and static typing and among different types sharing the same supertype: "
